      <h3>Programming</h3>
      <p>I am a second-year student pursuing a BS in Information Technology. I already know some programming languages, such as C and Java. I can already create a simple program and website, and I believe that I can create entertaining or helpful programs that people will find useful. </p>

      <img class="Artistic-skill" src="art.png" alt="art-img">
      <h3>Artistic Skill</h3>
      <p>My artistic ability and creativity are to create works of art like drawings, paintings, musical compositions, and photography. Art allows me to express my thoughts and feelings about the world in a different way. It's easy to see things in black and white, but I sometimes look at life through an artistic lens, which gives me a broader perspective and a more open mind. I use art to escape from the stresses of everyday life.</p>

      <img class="Singing-skill" src="sing.png" alt="sing-img">
      <h3>Singing</h3>
      <p>Singing is my passion, and it is what I live for. Singing makes me feel things that can't be put into words easily. It is what makes me feel alive and happy. I develop my singing ability by practicing, as it helps me learn new technique and helps me improve my singing ability.</p>

      <img class="Cooking-skill" src="cook.png" alt="cook-img">
      <h3>Cooking</h3>
      <p>Through cooking, I can let my creativity flow. It allows me to create something beautiful and peaceful while away from everything else. It also feels good to be able to take a break from everything else and just be alone in the kitchen. The creativity in my cooking starts when I am preparing my dishes. I love making decisions such as how I want them to look and what ingredients to add.</p>
